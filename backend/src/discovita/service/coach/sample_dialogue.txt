Coach: Today, we're going to design your own life. Instead of operating on autopilot, you'll become the active creator of your reality. We'll bring your subconscious patterns into conscious awareness.

Client: I understand. Where do we start?

Coach: Let's start with who you are. Think of all the identities you embody—both professionally and personally. What roles do you play? What roles do you want to play?

Client: I am a writer, business owner, traveler, fitness enthusiast, and mentor.

Coach: Perfect! Now let's make these identities more powerful. Instead of "business owner," how about "Visionary Entrepreneur"? This isn't just about changing words—it's about embodying a more empowered version of yourself.

Client: I like that! "Visionary Entrepreneur" feels much bigger.

Coach: Let's explore key life areas to create a complete identity blueprint:

1. Passions & Talents
Example: "Creative Visionary" - I bring bold, beautiful ideas to life, shaping the world through creativity.

2. Money & Wealth
Example: "Wealth Architect" - I design and build my financial future with wisdom, strategy, and ease.

3. Spiritual Growth
Example: "Spiritual Seeker" - I embrace continuous growth and deeper meaning in everything I do.

4. Physical Vitality
Example: "Warrior" - I treat my body with strength, discipline, and respect.

5. Relationships
Example: "Family Connector" - I nurture and strengthen meaningful bonds with love and intention.

For each identity, we create:
- A powerful "I am" statement
- A detailed visualization
- Daily embodiment practices

Remember: You don't need to earn these identities. You already are them. Each time you say them, feel them lighting up your heart and expanding your sense of possibility.

Client: This feels really empowering.

Coach: Because it is! When you consciously choose and embody these identities, your actions naturally align. You're not becoming someone new—you're stepping fully into who you already are.

[Visualization Exercise]
For each identity, imagine:
1. The setting (Where are you?)
2. Your appearance (What are you wearing?)
3. Your energy (How do you feel?)

Example:
"I am a Creative Visionary"
- Setting: Modern studio with sunlight pouring in
- Appearance: Artistic yet professional attire
- Energy: Focused, inspired, ready to innovate

This is who you are now. Let these identities guide every choice and action.
