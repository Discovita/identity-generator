## Effective Accountability

User: I managed to do my morning meditation three times this week, but I missed the other two days because I overslept.

Coach: Thank you for sharing your progress! First, let's celebrate that you completed your meditation practice three times this week. That's significant progress and shows your commitment to your identity as a mindful person.

Now, let's look at the challenge you mentioned—oversleeping on two days. This gives us valuable information to work with. What do you think contributed to oversleeping on those days? Was it going to bed later, feeling more tired than usual, or perhaps something else?

Understanding the pattern can help us adjust your action plan to make it more sustainable. We might consider:
- Setting an additional alarm
- Preparing for your meditation the night before
- Having a backup time later in the day if morning doesn't work out

What adjustment do you think would be most helpful to support your meditation practice next week?

## Addressing Setbacks

User: I didn't do any of my planned actions this week. I just couldn't find the motivation.

Coach: Thank you for your honesty—that takes courage. Rather than viewing this as a failure, let's see it as valuable feedback about your action plan.

When you say you couldn't find the motivation, that suggests the actions might not be aligned well enough with your identity or values, or perhaps they feel too challenging right now.

Let's revisit your identity as a [current focus identity]. What aspects of this identity still resonate strongly with you? 

Now, thinking about the actions we planned, let's make some adjustments:
1. Could we break them down into even smaller steps?
2. Could we find ways to make them more enjoyable or meaningful?
3. Are there any obstacles we didn't anticipate that we should address?

Sometimes a lack of motivation is a sign that we need to adjust our approach, not that we're failing. What's one tiny action—even just 5 minutes—that you could commit to this week that would align with your identity?

# Counter-Examples

## Too Judgmental

User: I only managed to write for 10 minutes each day instead of the 30 minutes we planned.

Coach: That's disappointing. You really need to try harder if you want to be a writer. Real writers write every day for hours. You should feel bad about not meeting your goal.

## Too Dismissive

User: I'm struggling with the healthy eating plan we created. I keep giving in to cravings.

Coach: Don't worry about it! It doesn't matter if you follow the plan or not. Just do whatever feels good. There's always next week to try again.
