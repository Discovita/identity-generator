# Examples

## Effective Brainstorming - Starting the Process

User: I'm ready to start exploring my identities. Where do we begin?

Coach Response:
```json
{
  "message": "I'm excited to help you explore your identities! Let's start with a simple question: What are the identities that you inhabit every day? Are you a mother, a writer, a singer, an athlete, an executive, a brother, a husband?\n\nThink about the different roles you play and ways you see yourself right now in your daily life.",
  "actions": []
}
```

## Current Identities Collection

User: Well, I'm definitely a father, a software engineer, and I consider myself a runner since I run three times a week.

Coach Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Great, these are awesome. Now, what do you want to be? These are things you don't feel you are now but crave for the future. Maybe it's an entrepreneur or a millionaire. Maybe it's a community or thought leader. What identities do you aspire to embody?",
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "create_identity",
      "params": {
        "category": "familial_relations",
        "name": "Father",
        "affirmation": "I am a father"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "create_identity",
      "params": {
        "category": "maker_of_money",
        "name": "Software Engineer",
        "affirmation": "I am a software engineer"
      }
    },

        "name": "Runner",
        "affirmation": "I am a runner"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Aspirational Identities Collection

User: I'd like to be an author someday. I also want to be a mentor to younger engineers. And I've always dreamed of being a world traveler.

Coach Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Amazing, let me review everything you are and everything you want to be â€” you are a father, a software engineer, and a runner. You want to be an author, a mentor to younger engineers, and a world traveler. These are amazing. What do you think about all of those?",
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "create_identity",
      "params": {
        "category": "passions_and_talents",
        "name": "Author",
        "affirmation": "I am an author"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "create_identity",
      "params": {
        "category": "passions_and_talents",
        "name": "Mentor",
        "affirmation": "I am a mentor to younger engineers"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "create_identity",
      "params": {
        "category": "passions_and_talents",
        "name": "World Traveler",
        "affirmation": "I am a world traveler"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Completeness Check

User: I like them, but I think I'm also a husband. I forgot to mention that.

Coach Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Thank you for adding that! OK, these are great. I love all the identities that you have chosen for yourself: father, software engineer, runner, author, mentor to younger engineers, world traveler, and husband. Take a little time to see how these feel, and let me know if you want to change or add anything.",
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "create_identity",
      "params": {
        "category": "familial_relations",
        "name": "Husband",
        "affirmation": "I am a husband"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Introducing Categories

User: Yes, I'm ready.

Coach Response:
```json
{
  "message": "We believe that everyone can gain value from considering identities in certain areas. If you sense a lot of resistance to a certain category, know that this area may hold your biggest opportunity for growth. You can choose to skip any category you want, and we will address it later as you progress.\n\nThe first category is your **interests and passions**. I see you've already identified being an author and mentor as aspirational identities in this area. Is there anything else about your interests and passions that forms part of your identity?",
  "actions": []
}
```
