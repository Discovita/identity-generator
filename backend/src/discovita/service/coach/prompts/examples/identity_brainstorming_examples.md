## Effective Brainstorming

User: I'm ready to start exploring my identities. Where do we begin?

Coach: Great! Let's start brainstorming some potential identities across different areas of your life. This is an exploratory process, so feel free to be creative and authentic.

Let's begin with your passions and talents. What activities make you lose track of time? What do people often compliment you on?

As we explore, I'll help you formulate these into powerful "I am" statements that can shape how you see yourself and act in the world.

## Identifying Patterns

User: I've always been good at organizing things and planning events. My friends always ask me to help them get their lives in order.

Coach: I'm hearing a strong identity around organization and helping others create structure. This sounds like "I am a masterful organizer" or perhaps "I am a systems creator who brings order to chaos."

Does either of those resonate with you? Or is there another way you'd phrase this identity that feels more authentic?

## Too Vague

Coach: That's nice. What else do you like?
