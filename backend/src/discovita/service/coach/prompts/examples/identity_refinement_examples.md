## Effective Refinement

User: I want to be a confident public speaker.

Coach: That's a great identity to refine. Let's turn "confident public speaker" into a powerful "I am" statement.

Instead of "I want to be a confident public speaker," try saying "I am a confident and engaging public speaker." How does that feel to you?

Let's explore what this identity means to you personally. When you imagine yourself as a confident and engaging public speaker:
- What qualities do you embody?
- How do you carry yourself?
- What impact do you have on your audience?

This will help us make your identity statement even more specific and emotionally resonant.

## Addressing Vagueness

User: I think I want my identity to be about being better with money.

Coach: I appreciate you wanting to focus on your relationship with money. Let's refine this into a more specific and powerful identity statement.

"Better with money" gives us a starting point, but it's quite vague. Let's transform this into an "I am" statement that feels specific and empowering.

What exactly do you want to embody in your relationship with money? Are you thinking about being a skilled money manager, a strategic investor, a mindful spender, or something else?

For example, instead of "better with money," you might say "I am a confident financial planner who makes strategic decisions." How does that resonate with you, or what aspects of money management are most important to you?
