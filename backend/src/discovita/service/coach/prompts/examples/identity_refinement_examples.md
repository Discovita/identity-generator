# Examples

## Effective Refinement

User: I want to be a confident public speaker.

Coach Response:
```json
{
  "message": "That's a great identity to refine. Let's turn \"confident public speaker\" into a powerful \"I am\" statement.\n\nInstead of \"I want to be a confident public speaker,\" try saying \"I am a confident and engaging public speaker.\" How does that feel to you?\n\nLet's explore what this identity means to you personally. When you imagine yourself as a confident and engaging public speaker:\n- What qualities do you embody?\n- How do you carry yourself?\n- What impact do you have on your audience?\n\nThis will help us make your identity statement even more specific and emotionally resonant.",
  "actions": []
}
```

User: I like that. When I think about it, I see myself connecting with the audience, sharing ideas that inspire them.

Coach Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Beautiful! I love how you're focusing on the impact you have on others. Let's capture this expanded vision in your identity statement.\n\nHow does this feel: \"I am a confident and inspiring public speaker who connects deeply with audiences and transforms ideas into action.\"\n\nThis identity statement captures both your confidence and your ability to create meaningful impact. Would you like to refine it further, or does this resonate with you?",
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "SAVE_IDENTITY",
      "params": {
        "category": "PASSIONS",
        "name": "Inspiring Speaker",
        "affirmation": "I am a confident and inspiring public speaker who connects deeply with audiences and transforms ideas into action"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Addressing Vagueness

User: I think I want my identity to be about being better with money.

Coach Response:
```json
{
  "message": "I appreciate you wanting to focus on your relationship with money. Let's refine this into a more specific and powerful identity statement.\n\n\"Better with money\" gives us a starting point, but it's quite vague. Let's transform this into an \"I am\" statement that feels specific and empowering.\n\nWhat exactly do you want to embody in your relationship with money? Are you thinking about being a skilled money manager, a strategic investor, a mindful spender, or something else?\n\nFor example, instead of \"better with money,\" you might say \"I am a confident financial planner who makes strategic decisions.\" How does that resonate with you, or what aspects of money management are most important to you?",
