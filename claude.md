I understand your vision for a structured life coaching application that goes beyond a simple chatbot wrapper. Your approach to implement a multi-stage methodology based on a professional coach's strategy is thoughtful, and you're right that naive prompting won't work well for such a complex system.
Here's a high-level implementation strategy:
Architecture Overview
Your system needs to manage:
State progression through a coaching workflow
User data persistence with proper retrieval strategies
Contextual prompting based on current stage
Quality control for LLM outputs
Core Components
State Machine: To manage the coaching flow
User Model: For storing and retrieving user information
Prompt Management System: For contextual prompting
Response Validator: For quality control
Pseudo-code Implementation
Let's start with the state machine to manage the coaching workflow:
class CoachingStateMachine:
    def __init__(self, user_id):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.user_data = UserDataStore(user_id)
        self.current_state = self.get_current_state()
        self.prompt_manager = PromptManager()
        self.validator = ResponseValidator()
    
    def get_current_state(self):
        # Fetch user's current state from database
        return self.user_data.get_coaching_state() or "introduction"
    
    def process_user_input(self, user_input):
        # 1. Get appropriate prompt for current state
        prompt = self.prompt_manager.get_prompt(
            state=self.current_state,
            user_data=self.user_data.get_relevant_data(self.current_state),
            user_input=user_input
        )
        
        # 2. Send to LLM
        llm_response = self.call_llm(prompt)
        
        # 3. Validate response
        valid, feedback = self.validator.validate(
            state=self.current_state, 
            response=llm_response
        )
        
        # 4. Retry if invalid
        if not valid:
            improved_prompt = self.prompt_manager.enhance_with_feedback(
                prompt, feedback
            )
            llm_response = self.call_llm(improved_prompt)
        
        # 5. Extract and store data
        self.extract_and_store_data(llm_response)
        
        # 6. Determine next state
        next_state = self.determine_next_state(llm_response)
        if next_state != self.current_state:
            self.transition_to(next_state)
        
        return {
            "response": llm_response,
            "next_actions": self.get_available_actions(),
            "progress": self.calculate_progress()
        }
    
    def extract_and_store_data(self, llm_response):
        # Extract structured data based on current state
        if self.current_state == "identity_creation":
            identities = self.extract_identities(llm_response)
            self.user_data.store_identities(identities)
        # Similar logic for other data types
    
    def determine_next_state(self, llm_response):
        # Logic to determine if we should move to next state
        # Could be rule-based or LLM-assisted
        return "next_state_name"
    
    def transition_to(self, new_state):
        self.current_state = new_state
        self.user_data.update_coaching_state(new_state)

For the User Data Store:
class UserDataStore:
    def __init__(self, user_id):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.db = Database()  # Your database connection
    
    def store_identities(self, identities):
        self.db.insert("user_identities", {
            "user_id": self.user_id,
            "identities": identities,
            "created_at": datetime.now()
        })
    
    def get_relevant_data(self, current_state):
        # Return only data relevant to current coaching state
        if current_state == "action_planning":
            return {
                "identities": self.get_identities(),
                "recent_actions": self.get_recent_actions(limit=3)
            }
        # Other state-specific data retrieval
        return {}

For the Prompt Manager:
class PromptManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prompt_templates = self.load_prompt_templates()
    
    def load_prompt_templates(self):
        # Load from files or database
        return {
            "introduction": "You are Leigh Ann, a professional life coach...",
            "identity_creation": """
                You are now helping the user identify their core identities.
                Previous conversation: {{conversation_history}}
                
                Guide them through the following steps:
                1. Explain what identities are (roles like "visionary entrepreneur")
                2. Ask thoughtful questions to discover their identities
                3. Summarize the identified identities
                
                Current identities (if any): {{existing_identities}}
            """,
            # Other templates
        }
    
    def get_prompt(self, state, user_data, user_input):
        template = self.prompt_templates[state]
        # Fill template with user data and conversation history
        return template.replace(
            "{{conversation_history}}", self.get_relevant_history()
        ).replace(
            "{{existing_identities}}", json.dumps(user_data.get("identities", []))
        )
        # Apply more replacements as needed

For the Response Validator:
class ResponseValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.validation_rules = self.load_validation_rules()
    
    def load_validation_rules(self):
        return {
            "identity_creation": [
                {
                    "check": "must_explain_identities",
                    "description": "Response must explain what identities are"
                },
                {
                    "check": "must_ask_questions",
                    "description": "Response must include at least 2 questions"
                },
                # More rules
            ]
        }
    
    def validate(self, state, response):
        if state not in self.validation_rules:
            return True, ""
        
        failed_checks = []
        
        for rule in self.validation_rules[state]:
            if not self.check_rule(response, rule["check"]):
                failed_checks.append(rule["description"])
        
        if failed_checks:
            return False, "Please improve your response: " + ", ".join(failed_checks)
        
        return True, ""
    
    def check_rule(self, response, rule_name):
        # Implementation of various check rules
        if rule_name == "must_explain_identities":
            return "identit" in response.lower() and len(response) > 100
        # Other rule implementations

Database Schema
Consider a schema like:
users
- id
- name
- email
- created_at

coaching_states
- user_id
- current_state
- last_updated

user_identities
- id
- user_id
- identity_name
- description
- created_at

user_actions
- id
- user_id
- identity_id (foreign key)
- description
- status
- created_at

coaching_sessions
- id
- user_id
- state
- conversation_json
- created_at

Implementation Recommendations
Use a workflow engine: Consider using a proper workflow engine like Temporal, Airflow, or even a simpler state machine library to manage the coaching flow.


Implement targeted retrieval: Only fetch the most relevant user data for each step rather than loading everything.


Multi-stage prompting: Break down complex reasoning into multiple LLM calls rather than one large prompt:


First call: Understand user input
Second call: Generate coaching response
Third call: Extract structured data
Fourth call: Quality check
Consider using structured outputs: Have the LLM return JSON to make extraction easier.


Implement error recovery: Allow the system to gracefully handle cases where the LLM response is not what was expected.


Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this architecture?
