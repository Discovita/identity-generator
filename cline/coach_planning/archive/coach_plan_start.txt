We are taking on a major new task.  

We have a class called CoachService that powers the 
POST -> /user_input API.  We might want to rename that
when we come up with a better name, but at any rate:

Right now the coach is a very naive wrapper around
chatgpt 4o.  

We need the coach to have the "personality" of the 
company CEO Leigh Ann.  In fact, it should introduce
itself to users as Leigh Ann.  

Sample dialogue of Leigh Ann providing life coaching
services is in 
./cline/coach_planning/sample_dialogue_original.md

We need to take this document and somehow use it 
- or some refinement of it - to make the coach
like Leigh Ann.  

For now we're going to build a chat system where the 
FRONT-END maintains all conversation and user state.
Eventually we will persist user information in a backend
database, but that is beyond the scope of the current task.
