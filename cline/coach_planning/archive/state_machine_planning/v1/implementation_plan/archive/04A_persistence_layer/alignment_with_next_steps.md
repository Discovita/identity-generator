# Alignment with Next Steps

The persistence layer implementation provides critical foundational support for upcoming steps in the implementation plan:

## Step 4: Context Manager
- The persistence layer enables reliable storage and retrieval of context data
- Strong typing and enum support ensures context state transitions are type-safe
- The flexible model support allows for future context model extensions

## Step 5: Identity Manager
- Ready to store and manage identity records with proper type safety
- Supports complex relationships between identities and other entities
- Enables efficient querying of identity data

## Step 6: State Machine
- Provides reliable persistence of state machine states
- Enum handling ensures state transitions are type-safe
- Supports both transient (in-memory) and persistent (SQL) state storage

## Step 8: Session Management
- Built-in support for session-related operations
- Efficient mapping between users and sessions
- Maintains session continuity across interactions

## Step 9: User Management
- Flexible model support ready for user data structures
- Efficient user record storage and retrieval
- Supports user-related relationships and queries

## Step 10: Integration Testing
- Both storage implementations are thoroughly tested
- Test infrastructure is in place for future integration tests
- Storage behavior is consistent and predictable

## General Benefits for Future Steps
1. **Type Safety**: All future models will benefit from strong typing and proper enum handling
2. **Flexibility**: New models can be added without modifying the persistence layer
3. **Testing**: Infrastructure for testing new features is already in place
4. **Performance**: Storage operations are optimized for both implementations
5. **Maintainability**: Clean interface makes future changes easier to implement
