# Summary of Changes for Step 1: Core Models

## Overview

This step implemented the core models needed for the state machine architecture. These models provide the foundation for the entire coaching system and define the structure for states, transitions, actions, and context.

## Changes Made

1. Created new model files in `backend/src/discovita/service/coach/models/`:
   - `state.py`: Defines the `CoachingState` enum and `StateTransition` model
   - `action.py`: Defines the `ActionType` enum, `Action` model, and `ActionResult` model
   - `context.py`: Defines the `CoachContext` model

2. Updated `models/__init__.py` to export the new models

3. Created a test file `backend/test/service_coach/test_context_models.py` to test the functionality of the `CoachContext` model

## Model Details

### CoachingState Enum

Defines the six states in the coaching process:
- INTRODUCTION
- IDENTITY_BRAINSTORMING
- IDENTITY_REFINEMENT
- IDENTITY_VISUALIZATION
- ACTION_PLANNING
- ACCOUNTABILITY

### StateTransition Model

Represents a valid transition between states with:
- from_state: The starting state
- to_state: The target state
- condition_name: Name of the condition function that determines if the transition is valid
- priority: Priority for resolving multiple valid transitions

### ActionType Enum

Defines the types of actions that can be triggered by the coach:
- SAVE_USER_INFO
- SAVE_IDENTITY
- MARK_INTRODUCTION_COMPLETE
- TRANSITION_STATE
- SAVE_VISUALIZATION
- SET_FOCUS_IDENTITY
- CREATE_ACTION_ITEM
- MARK_ACTION_COMPLETE

### Action Model

Represents an action triggered by the coach with:
- type: The type of action
- params: Parameters for the action

### ActionResult Model

Represents the result of executing an action with:
- success: Whether the action was successful
- message: Message describing the result
- data: Any data returned by the action

### CoachContext Model

Serves as the central data structure for the state machine with:
- user_id: Unique identifier for the user
- current_state: Current state in the coaching process
- conversation_history: Recent conversation history
- consolidated_summary: Summary of older conversation history
- user_profile: User's profile information
- metadata: Additional metadata for the coaching process
- get_prompt_context(): Method to format context for prompt templates

## Technical Notes

- All models use Pydantic v2 with ConfigDict instead of class-based Config to avoid deprecation warnings
- The models are strongly typed with clear type definitions
- The CoachContext model includes a method to format the context for prompt templates, which will be used by the prompt manager in Step 3
