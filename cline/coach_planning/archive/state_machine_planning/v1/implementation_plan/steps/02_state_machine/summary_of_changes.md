# Summary of Changes for Step 2: State Machine

## Overview

This step implemented the state machine component of the coaching system. The state machine manages the flow of the coaching process by defining states, transitions between states, and conditions for those transitions.

## Changes Made

1. Created new files in `backend/src/discovita/service/coach/state/`:
   - `__init__.py`: Exports the state machine factory function
   - `machine.py`: Implements the `CoachStateMachine` class
   - `transitions.py`: Defines standard transition conditions and transitions

2. Created stub files in `backend/src/discovita/service/coach/prompt/`:
   - `__init__.py`: Exports the `PromptManager` class
   - `manager.py`: Implements a stub for the `PromptManager` class

3. Created new files in `backend/src/discovita/db/`:
   - `__init__.py`: Exports the state store classes
   - `state_store.py`: Defines the `StateStore` interface

4. Enhanced models in `backend/src/discovita/service/coach/models/state.py`:
   - Added `TransitionCondition` enum
   - Added `ContextMetadataKey` enum

5. Created a test file `backend/test/service_coach/test_state_machine.py` to test the state machine functionality

6. Created an alignment document `cline/coach_planning/state_machine_planning/v1/implementation_plan/steps/02_state_machine/state_machine_understanding_alignment.md` to analyze the alignment between the implementation and the conceptual understanding

## Component Details

### CoachStateMachine Class

The core of the state machine implementation is the `CoachStateMachine` class, which:

- Manages a registry of condition functions that evaluate whether transitions are eligible
- Stores a list of transitions between states
- Provides methods to evaluate and execute transitions based on the current context
- Delegates to the `PromptManager` to get allowed actions for each state

### Transition Conditions

Transition conditions are implemented as functions that evaluate a `CoachContext` and return a boolean indicating whether the transition is eligible. Standard conditions include:

- `INTRODUCTION_COMPLETED`: Whether the introduction phase is completed
- `HAS_DRAFT_IDENTITIES`: Whether the user has any draft identities
- `HAS_MINIMUM_IDENTITIES`: Whether the user has at least 3 draft identities
- `HAS_REFINED_IDENTITY`: Whether the current identity has been refined
- `HAS_VISUALIZATION`: Whether the current identity has a visualization
- `HAS_ACTION_PLAN`: Whether the user has action items
- `ALWAYS`: A condition that is always true (used for fallback transitions)

### Standard Transitions

The implementation includes standard transitions between states:

- INTRODUCTION → IDENTITY_BRAINSTORMING (when introduction is completed)
- IDENTITY_BRAINSTORMING → IDENTITY_REFINEMENT (when minimum identities are reached)
- IDENTITY_REFINEMENT → IDENTITY_VISUALIZATION (when identity is refined)
- IDENTITY_VISUALIZATION → ACTION_PLANNING (when visualization is created)
- ACTION_PLANNING → ACCOUNTABILITY (when action plan is created)
- Any state → IDENTITY_BRAINSTORMING (always available as a fallback)

### Priority System

Transitions have a priority value that is used to resolve conflicts when multiple transitions are eligible. Higher priority transitions take precedence over lower priority ones.

### State Store Interface

The `StateStore` interface defines methods for loading and saving context, which will be implemented in Step 7 (Persistence Layer).

### PromptManager Stub

A stub for the `PromptManager` class was created to show how it will be used by the state machine. The stub includes a method to get allowed actions for each state, which will be fully implemented in Step 3 (Prompt Manager).

## Technical Notes

- All components use strong typing with clear type annotations
- The state machine is designed to be extensible, allowing new states, conditions, and transitions to be added
- The implementation includes comprehensive tests for all functionality
- The state machine integrates with the `CoachContext` model from Step 1
- The implementation uses enums for state names, condition names, and metadata keys to avoid magic strings
