# State Machine Understanding Alignment

This document analyzes the alignment between the implemented state machine and the conceptual understanding provided.

## Conceptual Understanding

The conceptual understanding of the state machine includes:

1. **States**: There are defined states that the coaching session can be in.
2. **State-Specific Prompts**: Each state is associated with specialized prompts for the LLM.
3. **Available Actions**: States are associated with available actions the LLM can take.
4. **State Transitions**: The LLM can optionally choose to transition to another state as one of its actions.

## Current Implementation Analysis

Let's analyze how the current implementation aligns with this understanding:

### 1. States

**Alignment: ‚úÖ Implemented**

The implementation defines states through the `CoachingState` enum:

```python
class CoachingState(Enum):
    """States in the coaching process."""
    INTRODUCTION = "introduction"
    IDENTITY_BRAINSTORMING = "identity_brainstorming"
    IDENTITY_REFINEMENT = "identity_refinement"
    IDENTITY_VISUALIZATION = "identity_visualization"
    ACTION_PLANNING = "action_planning"
    ACCOUNTABILITY = "accountability"
```

This clearly defines the possible states the coaching session can be in.

### 2. State-Specific Prompts

**Alignment: üîÑ Planned for Step 3**

The current implementation (Step 2) does not include the prompt management system. This will be implemented in Step 3 (Prompt Manager).

The `CoachStateMachine` class has a placeholder method `get_allowed_actions` that will eventually integrate with the prompt manager:

```python
def get_allowed_actions(self, state: CoachingState) -> Set[str]:
    """Get the set of allowed actions for a given state."""
    # This will be implemented in Step 3 when PromptManager is available
    raise NotImplementedError("PromptManager not yet implemented - will be added in Step 3")
```

### 3. Available Actions

**Alignment: üîÑ Partially Implemented**

The implementation defines actions through the `ActionType` enum:

```python
class ActionType(str, Enum):
    """Types of actions that can be triggered by the coach."""
    SAVE_USER_INFO = "save_user_info"
    SAVE_IDENTITY = "save_identity"
    MARK_INTRODUCTION_COMPLETE = "mark_introduction_complete"
    TRANSITION_STATE = "transition_state"
    SAVE_VISUALIZATION = "save_visualization"
    SET_FOCUS_IDENTITY = "set_focus_identity"
    CREATE_ACTION_ITEM = "create_action_item"
    MARK_ACTION_COMPLETE = "mark_action_complete"
```

However, the association between states and allowed actions is not yet implemented. This will be part of the Prompt Manager in Step 3.

### 4. State Transitions

**Alignment: ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Differs**

This is where the implementation differs from the conceptual understanding. The current implementation:

1. Defines transitions with conditions that are evaluated automatically based on the context
2. Uses a priority system to resolve conflicts when multiple transitions are eligible
3. Does not yet implement the ability for the LLM to trigger a transition as an action

The current implementation focuses on automatic transitions based on context conditions rather than LLM-initiated transitions. For example:

```python
# Introduction to Identity Brainstorming
state_machine.add_transition(
    CoachingState.INTRODUCTION,
    CoachingState.IDENTITY_BRAINSTORMING,
    TransitionCondition.INTRODUCTION_COMPLETED,
    priority=1
)
```

This transition happens automatically when the `INTRODUCTION_COMPLETED` condition is true, not as a result of an LLM action.

## Key Differences and Clarifications

### Automatic vs. LLM-Initiated Transitions

The current implementation focuses on automatic transitions based on context conditions, while the conceptual understanding suggests LLM-initiated transitions through actions.

Both approaches can coexist:

1. **Automatic Transitions**: The state machine automatically transitions based on context conditions (e.g., when enough identities have been collected)
2. **LLM-Initiated Transitions**: The LLM can also trigger a transition through the `TRANSITION_STATE` action

### The Role of Priority

The priority system resolves conflicts when multiple transitions are eligible at the same time. This is an implementation detail that wasn't mentioned in the conceptual understanding.

For example, if both a specific condition and the "always" condition are true, the priority determines which transition takes precedence.

## Integration Plan

The full integration of the state machine with prompts and actions will happen across multiple steps:

1. **Step 2 (Current)**: Implement the core state machine with transitions and conditions
2. **Step 3**: Implement the Prompt Manager with state-specific prompts and allowed actions
3. **Step 5**: Implement the Action System, including the ability for the LLM to trigger state transitions

## Recommendation

To fully align with the conceptual understanding, we should:

1. Ensure the Action System (Step 5) properly implements the `TRANSITION_STATE` action
2. Clarify the dual nature of transitions (automatic and LLM-initiated)
3. Consider whether the priority system is necessary or if it adds unnecessary complexity

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for the state machine, but the full alignment with the conceptual understanding will only be complete after Steps 3 and 5.
