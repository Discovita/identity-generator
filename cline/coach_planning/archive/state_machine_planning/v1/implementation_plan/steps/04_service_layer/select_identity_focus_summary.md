# SELECT_IDENTITY_FOCUS Action Implementation Summary

## Problem Addressed

The coach had a clunky transition to the identity refinement phase:

1. The coach explicitly mentioned "identity refinement phase" which broke immersion
2. The initial message in refinement phase didn't provide clear guidance or ask a question
3. The `current_identity_index` was not being set properly
4. There was no action for the coach to select which identity to focus on for refinement

## Changes Made

1. **Added SELECT_IDENTITY_FOCUS Action Type**
   - Added a new action type to `ActionType` enum in `models/action.py`
   - This allows the coach to explicitly select an identity to focus on during refinement

2. **Created SelectIdentityFocusParams Model**
   - Added a new model in `actions/models.py` to define the parameters for the action
   - The model takes an identity ID as input

3. **Updated Action Handler**
   - Modified the action handler to process the new SELECT_IDENTITY_FOCUS action
   - When this action is executed, it sets the current_identity_id in the state

4. **Improved State Model**
   - Changed `current_identity_index` to `current_identity_id` in the state model
   - This makes the code more robust by using IDs instead of array indices

5. **Updated Identity Refinement Prompt**
   - Added guidance for using natural language instead of technical terms
   - Added example questions to ask when transitioning to refinement
   - Added instructions for using the SELECT_IDENTITY_FOCUS action
   - Added example thoughtful, probing questions to ask about each identity

6. **Removed State Machine Dependency**
   - Removed the automatic state transitions handled by the state machine
   - Now relying entirely on the LLM's judgment to transition state using the TRANSITION_STATE action
   - Updated service.py, dependencies.py, and test files to remove state machine references

## Benefits

1. **More Natural Dialogue**
   - The coach no longer uses technical terms like "identity refinement phase"
   - Transitions feel more organic and conversational

2. **Clear User Guidance**
   - The coach now asks which identity the user wants to work on first
   - This provides a clear call to action for the user

3. **Deeper Identity Exploration**
   - Added thoughtful, probing questions to help users think deeply about their identities
   - Questions focus on daily life, core values, behaviors, self-perception, and actionable steps

4. **Improved State Management**
   - Using identity IDs instead of array indices makes the code more robust
   - The LLM has more control over state transitions, making the conversation flow more natural

## Example Conversation Flow

1. **User**: "I'm ready to move on."

2. **Coach**: "Great! We've explored several interesting identity possibilities together. Now let's take some time to deepen our understanding of each one. Which identity would you like to start with - Fun-Loving Parent, Innovative Software Engineer, or Mindful Self-Stylist?"
   - *Coach uses natural language without mentioning "refinement phase"*
   - *Coach asks a clear question about which identity to focus on first*

3. **User**: "Let's start with Fun-Loving Parent."

4. **Coach**: "Let's explore your Fun-Loving Parent identity. What does being a fun-loving parent look like in your daily life? What activities or moments make you feel most connected to your children through fun and play?"
   - *Coach uses SELECT_IDENTITY_FOCUS action to set current_identity_id*
   - *Coach asks thoughtful, probing questions about the identity*
