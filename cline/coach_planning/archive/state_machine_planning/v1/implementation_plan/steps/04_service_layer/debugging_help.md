# Coach Service Integration Debug Notes

## Issue
When testing the coach service, we're encountering an error with the OpenAI client integration:

```python
TypeError: get_response() got an unexpected keyword argument 'tools'
```

## Relevant Code Snippets

### Current Service Implementation
```python
# In service.py
response = await self.client.get_structured_response_with_responses(
    input_data=input_data,
    response_model=CoachLLMResponse,
    tools={"tools": get_available_actions()}  # This is causing the error
)
```

### OpenAI Client Implementation
```python
# In responses_structured.py
async def get_response(
    client: AsyncOpenAI,
    input_data: ResponseInput,
    response_model: Type[T],
    model: str = "gpt-4o",
    schema_name: Optional[str] = None,
    store: bool = True,
    previous_response_id: Optional[str] = None,
) -> StructuredResponseResult[T]:
    """Get a structured response from the OpenAI Responses API."""
    # Note: No 'tools' parameter in signature
    # Instead, tools are created internally from response_model:
    schema = StructuredOutputSchema.from_llm_response_model(
        response_model, 
        name=schema_name
    )
    
    tools = ResponseTools(
        tools=[schema.model_dump()],
        tool_choice=ToolChoice.specific(schema.name)
    )
```

## Analysis

1. The `get_structured_response_with_responses` method in our service is trying to pass a `tools` parameter
2. However, the underlying `get_response` function in `responses_structured.py` doesn't accept a `tools` parameter
3. Instead, `get_response` creates its own tools configuration based on the response_model's schema

## Key Questions

1. How are function definitions (from `get_available_actions()`) supposed to be integrated with the structured output schema?
2. Should we modify `get_response` to accept additional tools, or should we incorporate the function definitions into the response model's schema?
3. Is there a different client method we should be using for function calling with structured outputs?

## Next Steps

1. Review how function definitions should be properly integrated with structured outputs in the OpenAI client
2. Check if we need to modify the CoachLLMResponse model to include function definitions in its schema
3. Consider if we need a different approach to combine structured outputs with function calling
