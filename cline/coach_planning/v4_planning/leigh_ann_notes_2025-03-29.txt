What are the identities that you inhabit every day? Are you a mother, a writer, a singer, an athlete, an executive, a brother, a husband? (It would be cool if this eventually was gender-specific to the user, but that's for later.)


Client gives list


Great, these are awesome. Now, what do you want to be? These are things you don't feel you are now but crave for the future. Maybe it's a wife or mother. Maybe it's an entrepreneur or a millionaire. Maybe it's a community or thought leader.


Client thinks about it and then gives the list of what they want to be


Amazing, let me review everything you are and everything you want to be â€” coach reads the list back to the client. Example: you are a mother, wife, dancer, millionaire, community connector, teacher, coach, author... these are amazing. What do you think about all of those?


Client responds


Is there anything missing that you can think of before we proceed? Anything that you are now or that you want to be?


Yes, I want to add traveler


OK, these are great. I love all the identities that you have chosen for yourself. Take a little time to see how these feel, and let me know if you want to change or add anything.


Throughout, we will prompt users to take a break and let the ideas sink into their subconscious...
Welcome back! Is there anything you want to update or add?


User responds


If they change anything, the coach reads the list back to them again.


Client indicates they are happy with the list and want to move forward.


Now I want you to consider a few categories that we recommend everyone consider for their identities. Sometimes just the process of considering one of these identities can transform your life. Are you ready?


Client responds


We believe that everyone can gain value from considering identities in certain areas. If you sense a lot of resistance to a certain category, know that this area may hold your biggest opportunity for growth. You can choose to skip any category you want, and we will address it later as you progress.


Client responds


The first category is your interests and passions.
