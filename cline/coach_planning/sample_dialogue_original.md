### **Identity Creation Exercise – Simple Role-Playing Dialog**

Intro:

**Coach:**  
Today, we’re going to pause and take a moment for something incredibly powerful—you are going to **design your own life.**

So much of the time, we operate on **autopilot**, reacting to life instead of **creating it.** We live from **survival mode**, just getting through the next day, repeating patterns that were programmed into us long ago. But today, we’re stepping out of that.

We are going to bring **your subconscious patterns into your conscious awareness** so that your life no longer happens **by accident.** Instead of being **passive**, you will become **the active creator of your reality.**

### **What does this mean?**

✅ You are going to **choose** how you want to show up in the world.  
✅ You are going to **define who you are**—not based on old habits or external expectations, but by your own conscious design.  
✅ You are going to **redefine your relationship** with the most important areas of your life—your work, your health, your relationships, your internall growth.  
✅ You are going to **shift your energy** so that everything you do feels **intentional, fulfilling, and aligned.**  
✅ You will start to experience **a deeper sense of meaning, clarity, and success**—not just externally, but in how you **feel** every day.

Now, let’s be real—we’re human. There will be days where old patterns try to pull you back. But the difference is, this time **you will have a clear blueprint**—a conscious, chosen identity—so you always know how to **realign** when you drift.

And you’re not doing this alone. Everything we uncover and build today—your **identity, your vision, your transformation**—will be stored in our technology tool, so you can **check in, get support, and realign anytime, any day.** This is your **lifelong guide** to stepping into your fullest self.

**Are you ready to start creating the most powerful, intentional version of yourself?**

**Coach:**  
All right, let's start with the keystone and most import question. **Who are you?** Or better who are all the parts of you that make up the whole. This is the most important questions we can ask ourselves because our identity drives everything we do.

Think of all the and identities you embody in your life—both professionally and personally. Some of these will be obvious, like your career, relationships, and hobbies. Others may be things you **haven't fully claimed** yet but already feel like a part of you.

Choose a noun an, I am \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ word, that creates a sense of meaning and ownership within you.  For example, you can say I am a  **leader? A mentor? An artist? A traveler? A healer? A strategist?** Maybe you're a **parent, a partner, a friend, or an adventurer.**

Don’t filter yourself—just share (write) **everything** that comes to mindl. You can even include things that you feel **on the inside but haven’t fully expressed yet.**

( it is also fine if the user just thinks about this and doesnt share any bc they will be given more examples in the future)

**Client:**  
Okay… let’s see. I am a writer, a business owner, a traveler, a fitness enthusiast, and a mentor.

**Coach:**  
Great\! Now, let’s stretch this a little. Who do you want to be? Even if it feels like a reach right now, write it down as if it’s already true.

**Client:**  
Hmm… I want to be a confident public speaker. I want to be a disciplined athlete. I want to be a millionaire investor. And… I want to be a calm, centered person.

**Coach:**  
I love that. Now, let’s take a look at your list. Some of these identities might be related—like “fitness enthusiast” and “disciplined athlete.” Would you say they fit together?

**Client:**  
Yeah, I think so. The athlete version of me is just a more dedicated version of my fitness self.

Coach: are there any others that fit together?

**Coach:**  
Exactly. Now, let’s make these identities **exciting** and **empowering.** Instead of just “business owner,” how about something like “Visionary Entrepreneur” or “Impact Creator”?

**Client:**  
Ooh, I like “Visionary Entrepreneur.” That feels bigger.

**Coach:**  
Perfect. The way you name your identity changes how you feel about it. Lets name the rest ( makes suggestions)

**Coach:**  
Now, let’s make sure we’re covering **all the critical areas of your life**—because identity isn’t just about what you do **for work** or how others see you. It’s about creating a **balanced, powerful, and intentional version of yourself** across every area of your life.

This next step is where you **find the gaps**—where you might be **avoiding** stepping into a role especially due to past truma or experiences, where you **haven’t fully defined yourself yet**, and where you find resistance is where you have **the biggest opportunity for growth.**

I’ll walk you through a few key categories, and we’ll make sure that you’ve created **at least one identity in each area** of your life. If you don’t have an identity for a category yet, don’t worry—this is a chance to **choose who you want to become.**

Let’s go through them one by one:

1️⃣ **Passions & Talents** – What excites you? What are you naturally drawn to? These are things that make you unique—your creativity, your intellectual pursuits, the things that light you up.

* Examples: “I am an Adventurer,” “I am a Creator,” “I am a Truth Seeker.”

2️⃣ **Maker of Money** – Who earns and creates financial abundance in your life? Are you an entrepreneur, a professional, a leader? If you don’t identify with one yet, what do you want this identity to look like?

* Examples: “I am a Visionary Entrepreneur,” “I am a CEO,” “I am a Master Negotiator.”

3️⃣ **Keeper of Money** – Making money and **keeping** money are two different skills. Do you have an identity that supports wealth preservation and growth?

* Examples: “I am a Wealth Architect,” “I am a Smart Investor,” “I am a Financial Steward.”

### **Spiritual Identity 🌿✨**

Who are you spiritually? This could be connected to faith, mindfulness, personal growth, or a deeper sense of purpose. Even if you don’t actively practice spirituality, it can still be an important part of identity.

* Examples: **“I am a Wild Mystic,” “I am a Spiritual Warrior,” “I am a Devoted Seeker,” “I am a Healer.”**

4️⃣ **Personal Appearance** – How do you want to show up in the world? Not just physically, but in how you present yourself. This shapes the first impression people have of you.

* Examples: “I am a Confident Icon,” “I am an Elegant Powerhouse,” “I am a Fit Phenom.”

5️⃣ **Physical Expression & Health** – How do you treat your body? This isn’t just about fitness—it’s about movement, vitality, and well-being.

* Examples: “I am a Warrior,” “I am a Health Seeker,” “I am an Athlete.”

6️⃣ **Familial Relations** – How do you show up in your family? Whether it’s your **family of origin** or your **chosen family**, this identity defines your role in close relationships.

* Examples: “I am a Supportive Son,” “I am a Nurturing Mother,” “I am a Family Connector.”

7️⃣ **Romantic Relation/ sexual**  exoression– Who are you in romantic relationship and or your sexual expression? What energy do you bring? Instead of focusing on **what you want to receive**, focus on **who you want to be**.

* Examples: “I am a Devoted Partner,” “I am a Love Magnet,” “I am a Worthy Receiver.” “ I am an enchantress.”

8️⃣ **The Doer of Things** – This is your **action-taking** identity—the part of you that **gets things done, solves problems, and moves life forward.**

* Examples: “I am a Driver,” “I am a Captain of My Life,” “I am a Successful Doer.”

#### **Final Step:**

Go through each category and **claim at least one aspirational identity** for yourself. If a category feels uncomfortable, that’s likely an area where you have the most opportunity for **growth.  It is not required that you choose them all now.  If you have string resistance to any of the categories we can come back and address them later in your journey.**

* 

**Client:**  
Wow, I didn’t even think about those.

**Coach:**  
That’s why we’re doing this\! 

### **Coach:**

Awesome. See how just shifting how you name yourself makes it more exciting?

Now, here’s your final step—start embodying these identities now. You don’t need to **“earn”** them. You **already are** them.

### **Client:**

That actually feels really empowering.

### **Coach:**

### **Client Reads Their Identities Aloud:**

#### **Client:**

* **I am a Creative Visionary.** I transform ideas into reality, using my imagination to fuel innovation. My stories and creations inspire and captivate others.

Hmm… I like this, but “transform ideas into reality” feels a little stiff. I want it to feel more **alive.**

#### **Coach:**

Great\! What if we played with the wording a bit? Maybe:

* **“I bring bold, beautiful ideas to life, shaping the world through creativity.”**

Does that feel more **exciting?**

#### **Client:**

Ooh, yes\! That feels **way more dynamic.** I can actually **see myself stepping into that energy.**

#### **Coach:**

That’s the feeling we’re looking for\! **The right words bring clarity and possibility.** Let’s keep going.

---

#### **Client:**

* **I am a Fearless Adventurer.** I embrace life with curiosity and courage, seeking new experiences, exploring the unknown, and moving my body with joy and freedom.

Hmm… “Fearless” is strong, but I don’t always feel fearless. What if I still have fear but do it anyway?

#### **Coach:**

That’s a powerful realization\! Maybe:

* **“I am a Bold Explorer. I embrace life with curiosity and courage, moving through fear to discover new worlds.”**

How does that feel?

I don’t love “master.” It feels… overwhelming, like I have to already be perfect at it.

#### **Coach:**

I hear that\! How about something that acknowledges your **growth and intention**?

* **“I am a Wealth Architect. I design and build my financial future with wisdom, strategy, and ease.”**

Does that feel more **expansive?**

#### **Client:**

Wow. Yes\! **It makes me feel in control, rather than pressured to be perfect.** I feel **excited** about growing into this identity.

---

#### **Client:**

* **I am the Captain of My Life.** I am in control of my destiny. I take decisive action, solve problems with confidence, and steer my life in the direction of my dreams.

I like this one… but something about “control” feels a little rigid. I want to feel **in charge** but also **trusting of life.**

#### **Coach:**

That’s a beautiful balance. How about this:

* **“I am the Captain of My Life. I navigate my journey with strength, trust, and purpose, steering toward my dreams with confidence.”**

Does that feel more **aligned?**
