# Alignment with Next Steps

This document analyzes how the prompt manager implemented in Step 3 aligns with and supports the subsequent implementation steps (4-9).

## Step 4: Context Manager

The prompt manager implementation has direct integration points with the Context Manager:

- **Required Context Keys**: Each prompt template specifies the required context keys, which the Context Manager must provide
- **get_prompt_context Method**: The prompt manager relies on the CoachContext.get_prompt_context method to format context for prompts
- **Context Validation**: The prompt manager validates that all required context keys are present before formatting prompts

The Context Manager implementation in Step 4 will need to ensure that:
- The context includes all keys required by the prompt templates
- The get_prompt_context method correctly formats context for different prompt templates
- Context is properly maintained and updated as the coaching process progresses

## Step 5: Action System

The prompt manager implementation defines the foundation for the Action System:

- **Allowed Actions**: Each prompt template specifies the allowed actions for that state
- **get_allowed_actions Method**: The prompt manager provides a method to get allowed actions for each state
- **Action Validation**: The Action System will use the allowed actions to validate that actions are permitted in the current state

The Action System implementation in Step 5 will need to:
- Use the prompt manager to get allowed actions for the current state
- Validate that actions extracted from LLM responses are allowed in the current state
- Execute actions based on the action type and parameters

## Step 6: Service Layer

The prompt manager implementation provides core functionality for the Service Layer:

- **Prompt Generation**: The service layer will use the prompt manager to generate prompts for the LLM
- **Action Validation**: The service layer will use the prompt manager to validate actions
- **State-Specific Behavior**: The prompt manager enables state-specific behavior in the service layer

The Service Layer implementation in Step 6 will need to:
- Create and configure the prompt manager
- Use the prompt manager to generate prompts for the LLM
- Integrate the prompt manager with the Context Manager, State Machine, and Action System

## Step 7: Persistence Layer

The prompt manager implementation has indirect integration points with the Persistence Layer:

- **Template Reloading**: The prompt manager can reload templates from disk, which may be useful after persistence operations
- **Context Persistence**: The Persistence Layer will need to persist context that includes all required keys for prompts

The Persistence Layer implementation in Step 7 will need to:
- Ensure that persisted context includes all keys required by prompt templates
- Handle loading and saving context in a way that preserves all required information

## Step 8: API Layer

The prompt manager implementation provides the foundation for the API Layer:

- **Prompt Generation**: The API layer will use the prompt manager (via the service layer) to generate prompts
- **Action Validation**: The API layer will use the prompt manager (via the service layer) to validate actions
- **State-Specific Behavior**: The prompt manager enables state-specific behavior in the API layer

The API Layer implementation in Step 8 will need to:
- Expose endpoints that use the prompt manager to generate prompts
- Handle errors related to missing context keys or invalid actions
- Provide appropriate responses based on the current state

## Step 9: Frontend Integration

The prompt manager implementation provides the foundation for the Frontend Integration:

- **State-Specific UI**: The frontend can use the current state to show state-specific UI elements
- **Action Validation**: The frontend can use allowed actions to enable/disable UI elements
- **Error Handling**: The frontend can handle errors related to missing context keys or invalid actions

The Frontend Integration implementation in Step 9 will need to:
- Create UI components that reflect the current state
- Enable/disable UI elements based on allowed actions
- Handle errors related to missing context keys or invalid actions

## Conclusion

The prompt manager implementation in Step 3 provides a solid foundation for the subsequent implementation steps. It defines the core prompt generation and action validation functionality that will be used by the other components.

Key strengths of the prompt manager implementation:

1. **Flexibility**: The prompt manager can load prompts from markdown files, making it easy to update prompts without changing code
2. **Strong Typing**: All components use strong typing with clear type annotations
3. **Extensibility**: The prompt manager is designed to be extensible, allowing new prompt templates to be added
4. **Integration**: The prompt manager integrates well with the existing components from Steps 1 and 2
5. **Validation**: The prompt manager validates that all required context keys are present before formatting prompts

The prompt manager implementation aligns well with the overall architecture of the coaching system and provides a clear path forward for the subsequent implementation steps.
