# Alignment with Next Steps

This document analyzes how the state machine implemented in Step 2 aligns with and supports the subsequent implementation steps (3-9).

## Step 3: Prompt Manager

The state machine implementation has direct integration points with the Prompt Manager:

- **PromptManager Stub**: A stub for the PromptManager was created to show how it will be used by the state machine
- **get_allowed_actions Method**: The state machine delegates to the PromptManager to get allowed actions for each state
- **State-Specific Prompts**: The PromptManager will use the current state from the context to provide state-specific prompts

The state machine implementation provides a clear interface for the Prompt Manager to integrate with, ensuring that:
- Each state has a specific set of allowed actions
- The state machine can be queried for the current state to determine which prompt to use
- The state machine and Prompt Manager work together to guide the coaching process

## Step 4: Context Manager

The state machine implementation relies on the Context Manager to:

- **Maintain State**: The current state is stored in the CoachContext
- **Track Metadata**: Transition conditions evaluate metadata in the context
- **Provide User Information**: The context includes user profile and conversation history

The Context Manager implementation in Step 4 will need to ensure that:
- The context is properly initialized with the default state
- Metadata is updated as the coaching process progresses
- The context is persisted between sessions

## Step 5: Action System

The state machine implementation defines the foundation for the Action System:

- **Allowed Actions**: Each state has a specific set of allowed actions
- **TRANSITION_STATE Action**: The Action System will need to implement the ability for the LLM to trigger state transitions
- **Action Validation**: The state machine provides a way to validate that actions are allowed in the current state

The Action System implementation in Step 5 will need to:
- Parse actions from LLM responses
- Validate actions against the allowed actions for the current state
- Execute actions, including state transitions
- Update the context based on action results

## Step 6: Service Layer

The state machine implementation provides core functionality for the Service Layer:

- **State Management**: The service layer will use the state machine to manage the coaching process flow
- **Transition Evaluation**: The service layer will call the state machine to evaluate and execute transitions
- **Action Validation**: The service layer will use the state machine to validate actions

The Service Layer implementation in Step 6 will need to:
- Create and configure the state machine
- Integrate the state machine with the Prompt Manager, Context Manager, and Action System
- Handle the flow of the coaching process

## Step 7: Persistence Layer

The state machine implementation defines the interface for the Persistence Layer:

- **StateStore Interface**: Defines methods for loading and saving context
- **InMemoryStateStore Placeholder**: Provides a placeholder for the in-memory implementation

The Persistence Layer implementation in Step 7 will need to:
- Implement the StateStore interface for different storage backends
- Ensure that the context, including the current state, is properly persisted
- Handle loading and initializing the context for new and returning users

## Step 8: API Layer

The state machine implementation provides the foundation for the API Layer:

- **State Information**: The API will need to expose information about the current state
- **Transition Triggers**: The API may need to provide endpoints to trigger transitions
- **Action Validation**: The API will use the state machine to validate actions

The API Layer implementation in Step 8 will need to:
- Create endpoints that expose state information
- Ensure that the state machine is properly integrated with the API
- Handle state transitions and action validation

## Step 9: Frontend Integration

The state machine implementation provides the foundation for the Frontend Integration:

- **State Visualization**: The frontend will need to visualize the current state
- **Available Actions**: The frontend may need to show available actions based on the current state
- **Transition Feedback**: The frontend may need to provide feedback when transitions occur

The Frontend Integration implementation in Step 9 will need to:
- Create UI components that reflect the current state
- Update the UI when transitions occur
- Provide feedback to the user about the coaching process

## Conclusion

The state machine implementation in Step 2 provides a solid foundation for the subsequent implementation steps. It defines the core flow of the coaching process and provides clear integration points for the other components.

Key strengths of the state machine implementation:

1. **Clear Interfaces**: The state machine defines clear interfaces for other components to integrate with
2. **Extensibility**: The state machine is designed to be extensible, allowing new states, conditions, and transitions to be added
3. **Strong Typing**: All components use strong typing with clear type annotations
4. **Comprehensive Tests**: The implementation includes comprehensive tests for all functionality
5. **Alignment with Conceptual Understanding**: The implementation aligns with the conceptual understanding of the coaching process
