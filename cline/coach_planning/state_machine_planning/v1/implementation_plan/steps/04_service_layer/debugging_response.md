The error occurs because the `tools` argument is being passed to the `get_structured_response_with_responses` method, but the underlying `get_response` function in `responses_structured.py` does not support a `tools` parameter. Here's how to resolve this issue:

---

## **Resolution Steps**

### 1. **Understand Functionality of `tools`**
The `tools` parameter in your current implementation is meant to provide additional functionality or actions for the response generation. However, the `get_response` function internally generates its own tools based on the `response_model`. This means you cannot directly pass external tools unless modifications are made.

---

### 2. **Options for Fixing the Issue**

#### **Option A: Modify `get_response` to Accept External Tools**
You can update the `get_response` function to accept a `tools` parameter. This allows you to pass custom tools directly.

**Updated Code:**
```python
# In responses_structured.py
async def get_response(
    client: AsyncOpenAI,
    input_data: ResponseInput,
    response_model: Type[T],
    model: str = "gpt-4o",
    schema_name: Optional[str] = None,
    store: bool = True,
    previous_response_id: Optional[str] = None,
    tools: Optional[Dict] = None,  # Add tools parameter
) -> StructuredResponseResult[T]:
    """Get a structured response from the OpenAI Responses API."""
    
    if tools is None:
        schema = StructuredOutputSchema.from_llm_response_model(
            response_model, 
            name=schema_name
        )
        tools = ResponseTools(
            tools=[schema.model_dump()],
            tool_choice=ToolChoice.specific(schema.name)
        )
    
    # Use tools in response generation logic
```

This approach ensures backward compatibility while allowing external tools to be passed.

---

#### **Option B: Integrate Function Definitions into `response_model`**
Instead of passing external tools, incorporate your function definitions (`get_available_actions()`) into the schema of the `CoachLLMResponse`. This aligns with how `get_response` internally creates tools.

**Steps:**
1. Modify the `CoachLLMResponse` model in `llm.py` to include tool definitions.
2. Ensure that these definitions are part of the schema generated by `StructuredOutputSchema`.

---

#### **Option C: Use an Alternative Method for Tool Integration**
If modifying `get_response` is not feasible, consider using another client method that supports structured outputs and external tools explicitly. Check OpenAI's documentation or library updates for methods like function calling with structured outputs.

---

### 3. **Next Steps**
- Decide whether to modify the client (`Option A`) or adapt your model (`Option B`).
- Test changes thoroughly to ensure compatibility with existing workflows.
- If applicable, consult OpenAI's latest Python SDK documentation for alternative approaches.

By following one of these options, you can resolve the mismatch between your service implementation and the OpenAI client function signature.
