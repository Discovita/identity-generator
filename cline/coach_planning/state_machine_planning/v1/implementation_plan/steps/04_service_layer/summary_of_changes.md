# Step 4: Service Layer Implementation - Summary of Changes

## Overview

Implemented a stateless service layer that manages the coaching process through JSON state objects passed between frontend and backend. The implementation focuses on clean separation of concerns and strong typing.

## Key Components Implemented

1. **Core Service Layer**
   - Implemented `CoachService` class that coordinates:
     - LLM interactions through OpenAI client
     - State transitions through StateMachine
     - Prompt management through PromptManager
     - Action handling through dedicated action modules

2. **Action System**
   - Created dedicated action modules:
     - `definitions.py`: OpenAI function definitions for available actions
     - `handler.py`: Logic for applying actions to state
   - Actions include:
     - CREATE_IDENTITY
     - UPDATE_IDENTITY
     - ACCEPT_IDENTITY
     - COMPLETE_INTRODUCTION
     - TRANSITION_STATE

3. **Strong Typing**
   - Implemented strongly-typed models:
     - `ProcessMessageResult`: LLM response with message, state, and actions
     - `ResponseInput`: Structured input for OpenAI client
   - All state changes are handled through typed models
   - Proper error handling for LLM response parsing

4. **Prompt Context**
   - Created `PromptContext` model for structured prompt data
   - Includes:
     - User profile information
     - Current identities status
     - Session state
     - Conversation history

## Design Decisions

1. **Stateless Architecture**
   - All state is passed in request/response cycle
   - No database/persistence layer
   - State transitions handled through pure functions

2. **Type Safety**
   - Strong typing throughout the service layer
   - Proper model validation at boundaries
   - Clear error handling for invalid states

3. **Modular Design**
   - Separated concerns into focused modules
   - Clear interfaces between components
   - Easy to test and maintain

## Testing Strategy

The implementation supports:
- Unit testing of individual components
- Integration testing of the full message processing flow
- Mocking of LLM responses for predictable testing

## Next Steps

1. Implement API layer to expose service
2. Create frontend state management
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Document API and usage patterns
