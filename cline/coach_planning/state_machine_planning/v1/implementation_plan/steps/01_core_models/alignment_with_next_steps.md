# Alignment with Next Steps

This document analyzes how the core models implemented in Step 1 align with and support the subsequent implementation steps (2-6).

## Step 2: State Machine

The state machine implementation relies heavily on the core models:

- **CoachingState Enum**: Defines the possible states that the state machine can transition between
- **StateTransition Model**: Used to define valid transitions with conditions and priorities
- **CoachContext Model**: Used for evaluating transition conditions and storing the current state

The state machine implementation in `CoachStateMachine` class uses these models to:
- Register condition functions that evaluate against the context
- Add transitions between states
- Evaluate which transitions are valid based on the current context
- Execute transitions by updating the state in the context

## Step 3: Prompt Manager

The prompt manager uses the core models to provide state-specific prompts:

- **CoachingState Enum**: Used to determine which prompt template to use for the current state
- **ActionType Enum**: Used to define allowed actions for each state in prompt metadata
- **CoachContext Model**: The `get_prompt_context()` method formats context data for prompt templates

The prompt manager implementation will:
- Load prompt templates for each state
- Format prompts with context data using the structure defined in `get_prompt_context()`
- Provide allowed actions for each state based on the ActionType enum

## Step 4: Context Manager

The context manager directly manages the CoachContext model:

- **CoachContext Model**: Central data structure managed by the context manager
- **CoachingState Enum**: Used to track the current state in the context
- **ChatMessage Model**: Used to store conversation history in the context

The context manager implementation will:
- Load and create user context
- Add messages to conversation history
- Consolidate older messages into summaries
- Update user profile and metadata
- Integrate with persistence layer to save and load context

## Step 5: Action System

The action system uses the action models to execute actions:

- **ActionType Enum**: Defines the types of actions that can be executed
- **Action Model**: Represents actions to be executed with parameters
- **ActionResult Model**: Represents the results of action execution

The action system implementation will:
- Parse actions from LLM responses
- Validate actions against allowed actions for the current state
- Execute actions using appropriate handlers
- Return results of action execution

## Step 6: Service Layer

The service layer integrates all components that use the core models:

- **CoachContext Model**: Central data structure passed between components
- **CoachingState Enum**: Used to determine the current state and available actions
- **Action and ActionResult Models**: Used for executing actions and handling results

The service layer implementation will:
- Process user messages with state management
- Get prompts for the current state
- Send prompts to the LLM and get responses
- Execute actions from LLM responses
- Update context and handle state transitions

## Conclusion

The core models implemented in Step 1 provide a solid foundation for the subsequent implementation steps. They define the structure and relationships needed for the state machine architecture to function effectively. The models are well-aligned with the needs of each component and enable them to communicate and interact seamlessly.

Key strengths of the core models:

1. **Strong Typing**: All models use Pydantic with clear type definitions
2. **Clear Relationships**: The models define clear relationships between states, actions, and context
3. **Extensibility**: The models can be extended to support additional states and actions
4. **Serialization**: The models can be easily serialized for persistence
5. **Context Formatting**: The CoachContext model includes a method for formatting context data for prompts
