This is kind of the "meta-plan".   
I'm actually still writing the plan.  Here's what I know so far:

I am a software engineer and architect working on a major contracting 
project to build a chatbot for a life coach who wants me to put 
her proprietary coaching methodology into the chatbot.  
I have some example dialogues between the coach and her clients.  

The coach will not only provide free-form chat with the user, 
but will also occasionally be able to make API calls to my 
backend to update certain information about the user based 
on what it learns. 

In Step 1, we will implement a basic chatbot which is just
a thin wrapper around ChatGPT.

In following steps, we will specialize it and add AIPI calls 
for managing user state and creating identities.
