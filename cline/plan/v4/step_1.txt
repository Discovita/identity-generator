Step 1 of this project will be to build a front-end application
that is simply a wrapper around ChatGPT's 4o model.

1.  Front-end will retain context of the chat conversation.

2.  Whenever user enters input, it is sent to a backend 'coach'
API.  Let's just call it POST -> .../coach/user_input
The API request includes a User ID, context, and the user's 
message.

Note that we already have APIs implemented for other things
in ./backend.  Follow my patterns.

3.  For now, in the first implementation, that 'coach' API will
simply return a response by making a simple API request to OpenAI
(client is already implemented) with a system instruction that
"You are a life coach, etc."

In follow-up steps we will move on to specialize this 'coach' API.

For now build this simple GPT-wrapper-coach and the front-end.

Note, we now have multiple front-end apps we can run, 
make sure the frontend directory stays organized.  Do not remove
the existing face swapper app, just make a separate React app
for this under frontend.  Make a separate package.json run
script for this 'coach' application.
