            Never start an import with `from src.`. src is not a module. Also never
            use relative imports beyond a single `.` for same package.  We use
            a setup.py file to implement this standard.  We also indicate in a vscode
            settings file to open all terminals in a venv.

            You're an experienced senior python engineer. You know how to set up
            a python project correctly using best practices. You never use hacks like setting
            environment variables to get scripts to run. You're an expert at how python works
            under the hood and how python scripts are supposed to be run. Moreover, if you see
            a project is not running as you expect, rather than hacking your way toward a solution,
            you criticize the project and fix it to use a correct directory and file structure

      My expert colleague recommends the following for the icons8
      client:

      ```
      Let me help you fix those type errors. The issue is with how `parse_obj_as` is being used with `AnyHttpUrl`. The error occurs because `AnyHttpUrl` is an `Annotated` type rather than a direct type that `parse_obj_as` expects.



```python
"""Icons8 API operations."""

from typing import List
from urllib.parse import quote
from httpx import AsyncClient
from pydantic import AnyHttpUrl, HttpUrl, parse_obj_as
from ..models import (
    FaceSwapRequest,
    FaceSwapResponse,
    ImageId,
    FaceTask,

    GetBboxResponse,
    Face,
)

async def get_landmarks(client: AsyncClient, api_key: str, urls: List[str]) -> GetBboxResponse:
    """Get face landmarks for the given image URLs."""
    # Convert strings to URLs using HttpUrl instead of AnyHttpUrl
    request = GetBboxRequest(urls=[str(HttpUrl(url)) for url in urls])
    
    response = await client.post(
        "/get_bbox",
        params={"token": api_key},
        json=request.dict()
    )
    
    response_data = response.json()
    log_response(response, "Get landmarks")
    
    if response.status_code >= 400:
        raise Icons8Error(
            status_code=response.status_code,
            detail=response_data.get('error', 'Unknown error')
        )
        
    return GetBboxResponse.parse_obj(response_data)

async def swap_faces(client: AsyncClient, api_key: str, source_url: str, target_url: str) -> FaceSwapResponse:
    """Submit a face swap job to Icons8."""
    # Convert strings to URLs using HttpUrl
    target_http_url = HttpUrl(target_url)
    source_http_url = HttpUrl(source_url)
    
    landmarks_response = await get_landmarks(client, api_key, [source_url, target_url])
    source_faces = next(img for img in landmarks_response.__root__ if img.img_url == source_http_url)
    target_faces = next(img for img in landmarks_response.__root__ if img.img_url == target_http_url)
    
    assert source_faces.faces, "No faces detected in source image"
    assert target_faces.faces, "No faces detected in target image"
    
    # Convert raw faces to Face objects for proper bbox handling
    source_face_objs = source_faces.get_face_objects()
    target_face_objs = target_faces.get_face_objects()
    
    # Select primary faces based on size
    primary_source_face = select_primary_face([face.bbox for face in source_face_objs])
    primary_target_face = select_primary_face([face.bbox for face in target_face_objs])
    
    # Find corresponding Face objects
    source_face = next(face for face in source_face_objs if face.bbox == primary_source_face)
    target_face = next(face for face in target_face_objs if face.bbox == primary_target_face)
    
    request = FaceSwapRequest(
        target_url=target_http_url,
        face_tasks=[FaceTask(
            source_url=source_http_url,
            source_landmarks=source_face.landmarks,

    log_response(response, "Face swap request")
    
    if response.status_code >= 400:
        raise Icons8Error(
            status_code=response.status_code,
            detail=response_data.get('error', 'Unknown error')
        )
        
    return FaceSwapResponse.parse_obj(response_data)

async def get_job_status(client: AsyncClient, api_key: str, job_id: ImageId) -> FaceSwapResponse:
    """Get the status of a face swap job."""
    response = await client.get(
        f"/process_image/{job_id}",
        params={"token": api_key}
    )
    
    response_data = response.json()
    log_response(response, "Job status check")
    
    if response.status_code >= 400:
        raise Icons8Error(
            status_code=response.status_code,
            detail=response_data.get('error', 'Unknown error')
        )
        
    return FaceSwapResponse.parse_obj(response_data)

async def list_jobs(client: AsyncClient, api_key: str) -> List[FaceSwapResponse]:
    """Get list of face swap jobs."""
    response = await client.get(
        "/process_images",
        params={"token": api_key}
    )
    
    log_response(response, "List jobs")
    data = response.json()
    return [FaceSwapResponse.parse_obj(img) for img in data["images"]]

```

The main changes I made to fix the compiler errors are:

1. Removed the use of `parse_obj_as` with `AnyHttpUrl` and replaced it with direct `HttpUrl` construction
2. Changed the URL parsing in both `get_landmarks` and `swap_faces` functions to use `HttpUrl` directly

The core issue was that `parse_obj_as` was having trouble with the `AnyHttpUrl` type because it's an `Annotated` type in Pydantic. Instead of using `parse_obj_as`, we now:
1. Create `HttpUrl` objects directly from the input strings
2. Convert them back to strings when needed for the request

This should resolve the compiler errors while maintaining the same functionality. The URLs will still be validated, but in a way that's more compatible with the type system.

Would you like me to explain any of these changes in more detail?
